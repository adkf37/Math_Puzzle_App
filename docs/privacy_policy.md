# Privacy Policy (Draft, MVP)

## Summary
This app is designed for children and keeps data collection minimal and local-first.

## Data collected
- Local device data:
  - profiles (name + icon)
  - puzzle progress (solve status, time, hints used)
  - daily streak and cached daily puzzle ids
- Optional anonymous telemetry events (if enabled):
  - `puzzle_start`
  - `hint_used`
  - `puzzle_solved`
  - `time_to_solve`

## Data not collected in MVP
- No chat messages
- No public profiles or leaderboards
- No ad identifiers or personalized ads
- No in-app purchases or payment data

## Child safety defaults
- No external links in child gameplay flow.
- No social features in MVP.
- No precise location collection.

## Retention and controls
- Local progress is stored on device and can be removed by clearing app data.
- If telemetry is enabled in future builds, it remains anonymous and aggregate.
